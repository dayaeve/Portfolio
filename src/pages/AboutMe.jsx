      <p className='about__p'>I am a person very focused on achieving new goals, and that is why I am finishing my Full Stack Development studies at Academlo. I am also a Systems Information Accountant and Tax Preparer. I found that I love and am very passionate about everything that is graphic design and web development because that way I can demonstrate my effort and talent in each project that comes my way. I like to spend time analyzing the new codes and doing the logic in each of them. I am open to carrying out any project or new challenges that need to be done.</p>
